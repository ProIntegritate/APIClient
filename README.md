# APIClient code examples to create a APIServer Service module

```
APIClient_CSharp.cs = Code example for CSharp
APIClient_VBNET.vb = Code example for VB.NET
```
F# currently has no source but will work. Please use .NET 8 to create Service modules.

Other languages can be used as well as long as:
1. They can parse command line arguments
2. They can decode Base 64 into a string
3. They can write to Stdout.

So if you want to use ADA, Brainfuck or Cobol to write service modules, go ahead - but it is not supported by me.
